## Objective:
Create a data sonicator with a database to view and listen to graphs or drawings.

## Explanation of the problem:
Using Pure Data and Processing, based on data collection and manipulation, it should be generated that as this information is collected, Pure Data should generate sounds and Processing should graph this information in some way, showing the change between the visual and the sound.

## Proposed Solution:
To carry out the work, the graphic part was made in processing where it receives the data from the data set that we chose, to read said information and be able to do various calculations with it, so that later with various actions signals are sent from processing to receive it in pure data to be able to execute the sound together with the visual, in this way we exemplify in our case a data set of performance and use of mobile devices in a 3D visual and soft sound environment.

## Conclusion:
TIn conclusion, I think we did a good job enriching everything learned so far in the subject and applying it to bring it to an adequate exemplification such as processing using pure data.
